- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Deboo08, a big fan of basketball, music, a small fan of coding and language study.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in watching basketball games and study high-level basketball skills, also for front-end development.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js, Vue.js and TypeScript, and I am looking forward studying more frames and skills in Web/front-end development.
- ğŸ“« You can find me in Deboo08.github.io
